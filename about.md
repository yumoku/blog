  When I was en elementary student, I was very talktive even at classes. And teacher called students like me "Huabaozi" which means Baozi of Words. 
  We know Baozi is a traditional food in Chinese speaking regions, it has thin flour skin and contains meat or vegetables inside. Thus Huabaozi means
  people who are full of words. I guess my talktive behaviors were only the exterior and inside I just loved the freedom and in my sub-concious, I felt
  my freedom was limited. I guess after so many years, from communist occupied areas to united States of America, I just haven't changed.
