  When I was an elementary student, I was very talktive even during classes. In Chongqing, teachers called students like me "Huabaozi" 
  which means Baozi of Words. We know Baozi is a traditional food in Chinese speaking regions, it has thin flour skin with meat or/and
  vegetables inside. Thus, Huabaozi means people who are full of words. I guess my talktive behaviors were only the exterior and inside
  I just loved the freedom and in my subconcious, I felt my freedom was limited. I guess after so many years, from communist occupied 
  areas to united States of America, I just haven't changed.

This blog is mainly used to record my studies, as program-think recommended in his post:

But it also contains my random thoughts as well.


Thanks for reading!
